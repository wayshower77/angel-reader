## AngelReader: The E-book, Audio-book & Library Loader in One Application
  Hi, friend! Welcome to the Github corner of the AngelReader project!
  This is an app that we created using Python 3.6 and it's still young and 
  under continuous development.
  
  The app is *minimalist* with an 82 kilobytes engine, in its current release,
  *robustly* running three mini-libraries of 345 megabytes of various e-books
  and audio-books through its *powerful* Library Selector.
  
  By tweaking and adjustments of the source code the AngelReader app can be 
  configured to load any number of e-books in combination with audio-books on
  any variety of subjects, arranging them nicely in their respective libraries.
  
#### Binary Files
  
  The complete binary files for the Windows OS platform can now be downloaded 
  from [the Sourceforge website] (https://sourceforge.net/projects/angelreader)
  for the awesome experience of the AngelReader app. This is the latest AngelReader
  version 1.4 release.
  
  Earlier standalone library releases (just from last September, 2018),  but without
  the AngelReader Library Selector, are also available from [the OSDN website]
  (https://osdn.net/projects/angel-reader-01). These earlier binary releases are 
  also for the Windows OS platform.
  
  The download files for the Linux distros will follow soon in future releases.
  
#### Features

  Summarily, here are some of the main features of the AngelReader application:
  * customizable fonts and page color
  * reziable windows
  * user friendly menus
  * easy to understand functions
  * open source software
  * cross platforms
  * minimalist but powerful
  * can be personalized or tailor-made according to
  the wants of an individual, a company, a school
  to meet particular needs
